# elsie: A pedagogical LC-3 CPU simulator #

This project implements a hardware emulator for the LC-3: a little computer with
a simple ISA from Patt and Patel's
[*Introduction to Computing Systems: from bits & gates to C/C++ and beyond*](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/introduction-computing-systems-bits-gates-c-c-beyond-patt-patel/M9781260150537.html).

The LC-3 is a 16-bit architecture with 16 kilobytes of byte-addressable RAM,
several general purpose registers, rudimentary arithmetic and logic
instructions and simple serial I/O.

The problem, of course, is already solved. The textbook authors provide a
simulator for students as well as additional learning tools and there are many
other fantastic implementations shared online freely already. Your time is
better off spent with any of those.

The goal of this implementation is merely to learn. As ever, I am seeking to
understand the essence of computing.
