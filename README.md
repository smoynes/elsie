# `ELSIE`: A pedagogical LC-3 simulator #

This is `ELSIE`, a virtual machine for the LC-3: a little computer that is
simple, comprehensive, and imaginary.

The computer was designed as a learning tool for undergraduate
computer-engineering students. It is described in detail in an excellent
textbook, Patt and Patel's *Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits & Gates
to C/C++ and Beyond*[^1], 3ed.

The LC-3 instruction set architecture includes:

- a single data type: signed integers stored as 16-bit words
- word-addressable RAM with 16-bit  address space
- several general purpose registers
- rudimentary arithmetic and logic operations
- memory-mapped I/O
- hard- and software interrupts
- a privileged mode with a basic operating system
- an instruction set compact enough to fit on a single page

While similar in many respects to the x86 ISA, the LC-3 is radically simpler in
almost every way. Unlike the sprawling x86, with thousands of instructions,
dozens of addressing modes, multicore execution, an intricate memory model, many
advanced features, and over 40 years of history etched into silicon, the LC-3
remains a tractable system that is comprehensible by an individual. It is a lot
closer to PDP/11 machines than anything you have in your home or pocket.

Personally, there remain many computer things that baffle me. Despite ten
thousand hours of computing, I feel lost and uncertain when it comes to some of
the rudiments of the field:

- computer architecture
- assembly programming
- operating systems
- computing history

This slightly absurd project is for experiential learning[^facecloud]: reading,
writing, conversations, asking questions, finding answers, and solving problems.
It is to be hoped that by using the old ways, by holding the master craftsman's
tools, and building something cute and useless, I will gain a better
understanding of computing.

Hardware simulators already exist for the LC-3 architecture, of course. The
textbook publishers provide one and there are many others freely available
online. This one is admittedly a mere reinvention of the wheel. Nevertheless,
the design and engineering process sometimes reveals something fundamental about
either ourselves or our world.

I have lots ideas for experiments to bring into the lab. I've thought about:

- simulating the LS-3 ISA in software
- writing some programs in assembly, translating to machine code
- running some programs written by others
- building development tools like an assembler, linker, loader, and step-wise
  debugger
- building a simple compiler for high-level language[^2]
- extending the ISA with new instructions, data types, or a math co-processor
- adding new I/O devices like a serial console, a tape storage, block storage,
  or network emulators and adapters
- expanding the operating system, with `TRAP` extensions, runtime library,
  application services, or even a microkernel
- concurrency and parallelism, _e.g._ communicating sequential processes,
  preemptive multitasking, multicore execution

Admittedly, some of these experiments are pretty straightforward, while others
appear daunting and complex; some are immediate goals, but most are mere thought
experiments. Trying to do all of that work might be a path in madness.

In the meantime, feel free to browse the code or follow the project if you enjoy
the absurdist theatrics of a curious software engineer. As ever, I seek to
understand the essence of computing and to embody _Shokunin Kishitsu_ (ËÅ∑‰∫∫Ê∞óË≥™),
the artisan's spirit.

You are welcome to reach out if you'd like to join me on this exploration.
