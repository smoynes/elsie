// Device represents an external device with which a program can read or write data.
//
// If a device has a simple I/O model and supports reading or writing a single word of data, it can
// implement the [RegisterDevice] interface. Otherwise, for more complicated device state or I/O
// models, a device should implement the [Driver] interface, instead. See [DisplayDriver] for an
// example.
type Device interface {
	device() string
}

// RegisterDevice represents a device that has a single, lonely register for I/O. In contrast to
// more complicated devices, a RegisterDevice does not have other device state and can act as its
// own driver. This type of device exposes three operations:
//
//   - Init, to configure the device,
//   - Get, to read a word from the device, and
//   - Put, to write a word to the device.
//
// Devices may add validation or custom behaviour therein. A minimal implementation would look like:
//
//	type SomeDevice Register
//	func (dev SomeDevice)  device()          string   { return "CoolDevice()" }
//	func (dev SomeDevice)  Get()             Register { return Register(dev)  }
//	func (dev *SomeDevice) Put(val Register)          { *dev = val            }
//
// Abstractly, this models a single register, but in theory could be just about any kind of device.

// the interrupt controller.

	// InterruptRequested returns true if the device has requested I/O service and interrupts
	// are enabled for the device.
	InterruptRequested() bool

	// Init initializes the device during system startup. The driver can configure interrupts,
	// initialize device-state, and allocate resources, as needed.
