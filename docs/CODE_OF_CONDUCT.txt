                                Codes of Conduct
================================================================================

Members of this project are expected to abide by one of two ancient Codes of
Conduct, at their discretion.

        One should  never do  something to  others that one  would regard  as an
        injury to  one's own self.  In brief, this  is dharma. Anything  else is
        succumbing to desire.
