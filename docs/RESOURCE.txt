        Resources
=========================

The authors of the following resources are true heroes.

The textbook is, of course, required reading. All due credit to Yale N. Patt and
Sanjay Patel:

  Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits & Gates to C/C++ & Beyond, 3e.

Student resources for second edition. There are problem and solution sets that
are useful, even if they do reference a previous edition with a few significant
differences:

The learning tools used in courses taught by Dr. Patt. Cross platform GUI and
CLI, assembler, tester, and samples. It is updated to the third edition and is
indispensable:
