      Simplicity and elegance are unpopular because they require hard
      work and discipline to achieve and education to be appreciated.
      The tools we use have a profound (and devious!) influence on our
      thinking habits, and, therefore, on our thinking abilities.
      -- Edsger Dijkstra.

           BIG IDEAS
-----------------------------

 I've thought about:

  - running some programs written by others;
  - building a simple compiler for high-level language that generates LC3ASM code;
  - extending the ISA with new instructions, data types, or a math co-processor;
  - adding new I/O devices tape storage, block storage, or network emulators and
    adapters;
  - expanding the operating system, with new system calls, a runtime library,
    IPC services, or even a microkernel;
  - concurrency and parallelism, _e.g._ co-operative sequential processes,
    preemptive multitasking, multicore execution.

            TODO
-----------------------------

- MONITOR: (this is a lot of work)
  - [x] TRAP x21
  - [x] TRAP x23
  - [x] TRAP x25
  - [ ] TRAP x20 GETC
  - [x] "linker", hex encoding
  - [ ] exception handlers
  - [ ] interrupt handlers
- [ ] EXEC: - wire up terminal I/O:
- [ ] REPL: step debugger shell
- [ ] DOCS:
  - tutorial: WIP
    - [ ] assembly programming
  - [ ] development
  - [ ] design
- [ ] ASM:
  - [ ] document grammar
  - directives:
    - [ ] .END
    - [ ] .EXTERNAL
    - trap aliases: HALT, IN, PUTS, OUT
- [ ] LINK: code linker
- [x] LOAD: load intel hex system images
- [ ] TIMER: simple timer device
- [ ] NEWLANG: interpreted language; threaded compiler
- [ ] WEBASM: stellar portability

... more to come.
