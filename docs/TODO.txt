           IDEAS
-----------------------------

 I've thought about:

  - running some programs written by others;
  - building a simple compiler for high-level language;
  - extending the ISA with new instructions, data types, or a math co-processor;
  - adding new I/O devices tape storage, block storage, or network emulators and
    adapters;
  - expanding the operating system, with new system calls, a runtime library,
    IPC services, or even a microkernel;
  - concurrency and parallelism, _e.g._ co-operative sequential processes,
    preemptive multitasking, multicore execution.
