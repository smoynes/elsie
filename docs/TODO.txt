      Simple tools for complex problems -- a text file is often all you need.

  - [ ] "linker", hex encoding
- [ ] EXEC: keyboard works
- DOCS:
  - [.] tutorial
  - [ ] design
  - [.] development
- [ ] MONITOR: trap, exception, and interrupt routines
- ASM:
  - [.] document grammar more completely
  - directives remaining:
    - [ ] .END
    - [ ] .EXTERNAL
- [ ] TERM: finish the terminal I/O
- [ ] LINK: code linker
- [ ] LOAD: load intel hex system images
- [ ] DUMP: intel hex encoder
- [ ] CLI: sub commands for tools, terminal, repl

      demo)
- [ ] REPL: step debugger shell
- [ ] TIMER: simple timer device
- [ ] NEWLANG: interpreted language; threaded compiler
- [ ] WEBASM: portability

... more to come.

           IDEAS
-----------------------------

 I've thought about:

  - running some programs written by others;
  - building a simple compiler for high-level language;
  - extending the ISA with new instructions, data types, or a math co-processor;
  - adding new I/O devices tape storage, block storage, or network emulators and
    adapters;
  - expanding the operating system, with new system calls, a runtime library,
    IPC services, or even a microkernel;
  - concurrency and parallelism, _e.g._ co-operative sequential processes,
    preemptive multitasking, multicore execution.
